# Class Leveling Editor

This Foundry VTT module allows the DM to edit the features automatically gained when leveling up a PC. For instance your could replace Foundry's provided class features with the ones found in DAE. You could also set up the class features to be automatically gained for all the non-SRD subclasses.

## How to

Go to the module settings for Class Leveling Editor, there you can open a form that will let you edit or remove the current features for the selected class. Or you could add new ones by dragging features (items) from compendiums or the items directory into specific levels.

All leveling information is saved to the world.

## Dependency

This uses [another module](https://github.com/ZoltanTheDM/Class-Exposure) which is very small and hijacks the data source for the DnD5e's leveling information.

This works for version 1.4.1 of the DnD5e system. Hopefully someday this will be officially supported.

## TODO

* Add support for adding and removing classes and subclasses
* Improve the css
