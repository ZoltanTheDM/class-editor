# Class Leveling Editor

This Foundry VTT module allows the DM to edit the features received based on the actor's class, subclass and level for DnD5e system.

Got to the module settings for Class Editor where you can open a form that will let you edit these features by dragging features (items) from any compendium or items directory into specific levels for a class / subclass.

# Dependency

This uses [another module](https://github.com/ZoltanTheDM/Class-Exposure) which is very small and hijacks the data source for the DnD5e's leveling information.

# TODO

* Add support for adding and removing classes and subclasses
